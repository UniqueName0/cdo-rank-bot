a discord bot to automatically give roles to users based on their rank in cdo(castle defense online)
made with discord.py

![alt text](https://github.com/UniqueName0/cdo-rank-bot/blob/main/images/demoImageThing.png?raw=true)

it currently only works for people that have english selected as their language in cdo, I'll be adding support for more languages later.

to use the bot simply post a screenshot of your rank from the "my info" tab and it will give you your role within a few minutes.

(also, I know the code is kinda spaghetti, but everytime I try to organize it I end up accidently breaking something)
